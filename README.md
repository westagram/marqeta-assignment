# marqeta-assignment

Hello,

I ran into an issue during the assignment, particularly when trying to create a card. 

As you can see from the image "_Card.png", I'm getting an error saying "Recipient address needs to be defined at least one of Card, Card Holder or Card Product". However, when creating a user (see image "_User.png"), I do have the user's address on file as one of the fields.

This blocker eventually stopped me from creating the test automation for card creation and transactions. However, I've created the test automation for User Creation and Card Product Creation, both can be found in the Test directory.

To view the test result, you can go to "Test -> *any of the 2 subdirectories* -> Output" and open up "log.html" in a browser (I might have potentially found a bug in the Card Product Creation, hence a failed test case).

As for integrating to a CI, I use Jenkins to integrate my robot scripts to the server. However, I cannot complete this optional task without being given a Jenkins server.

I also attached an excel file as a documentation to all my test cases. If for some reason it is unable to view, you can also view it from this google link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4hwd1NE1lF8qQTCYXKNsmSUIYUPaV3JxW8BW9s2c88/edit?usp=sharing

If the blocker I mention is addressed, I'm more than happy to finish up the assignment. Otherwise, I have submitted what I could to the best of my ability and what the API is allowed. Please let me know if there is any question from my side, I will be more than happy to answer!
